## Licensing

[Clustergrammer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clustergrammer), [Clustergrammer2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clustergrammer2), and [Clustergrammer-GL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clustergrammer-gl) are packages originally developed by the [Human Immune Monitoring Center](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/human-immune-monitoring-center) and [Ma'ayan lab](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/maayanlab/) at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](http://icahn.mssm.edu/).

This work is now being continued by [Gumus Lab](https://gumuslab.github.io/), also at ISMMS, and the code is being updated and maintained so it can be used in genomics project that the Gumus Lab is working on.

The project lead is [Kevin Ulrich](https://github.com/moromis), who can be [contacted here](kevin.ulrich@mssm.edu).

The original documentation for Clustergrammer and all its associated projects is [located here](http://clustergrammer.readthedocs.io), though it mainly applies in terms of creating formatted data with [Clustergrammer-PY](https://clustergrammer.readthedocs.io/clustergrammer_py.html) and the [desired format for the data for Javascript applications](https://clustergrammer.readthedocs.io/clustergrammer_js.html#visualization-json).

The [original license](https://clustergrammer.readthedocs.io/license.html) still applies, and the code is MIT-licensed.
